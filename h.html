	Quick hummus recipe This recipe makes quick, tasty humus, with no messing.
	It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
	Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.
	It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

	<p><em>Hummus</em>, that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food. 
	It deserves it.
	All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right. 
	It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and <strong>olive oil in most traditional versions.</strong>
